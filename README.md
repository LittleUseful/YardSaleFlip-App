# YardSaleFlip

YardSaleFlip is a project aimed at helping users make informed decisions while shopping at yard sales. By taking a photo of an item found at a yard sale, the app will check its price on eBay and provide information to help users determine if it's worth purchasing.

## Project Overview

Yard sales and garage sales are excellent places to find hidden treasures, but it can be challenging to assess the value of items on the spot. Yard Sale Flipper simplifies the process by using eBay data to estimate an item's market value.

## Project Goals

Our primary project goals are as follows:

- Develop a user-friendly mobile application that allows users to take photos of yard sale items.
- Integrate with eBay's API to fetch real-time pricing and availability data for those items.
- Analyze eBay data to provide users with insights into an item's market value.
- Offer recommendations on whether to buy an item based on eBay data.
- Provide an easy-to-understand interface for users.

## Features (Planned)

While the project is in its early stages, here are some features we plan to implement:

- **Item Photo Recognition**: The app will analyze item photos to identify key features.
- **Real-Time eBay Price Check**: Yard Sale Flipper will fetch up-to-date pricing data from eBay.
- **Value Assessment**: The app will provide an assessment of the item's value and whether it's a good buy.
- **User Profiles**: Users will be able to create profiles and keep track of their yard sale finds.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the planning and development phase. We're actively working on the initial design and concept.
